# Project Mongo API

A project to build an API with MongoDB and using Mongoose models.


## The problem

First I tried creating simple endpoints and then experimenting more with queries and MongoDB methods like limit() and sort().

Further on I want to simplify my code and make the filtering and queries more effective as I know I can simplify it more than I have at the moment.
